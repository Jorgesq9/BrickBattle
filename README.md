<h3 align="center"> HTML </h3>

<p align="center">   //Day1
1--> I made an html with the title of the page <title>BrickBattle</title.
2--> I made 3 div to separate the content of the 3 game screens, Start, Game and End of game.
3--> Link the HTML with CSS and with the two JS Files

//Day2

1--> Change the End-Game div because it was not capturing what should be shown on the screen, only the title.</p>
